# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

## A Rock, Paper, Scissors game created with HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

I created this project as part of my journey through the Odin Project curriculum. The game allows a player to compete against the computer in the classic game. I utilized this opportunity to enhance my web development skills, particularly in DOM Manipulation. Initially, I developed the game using the console, then added a user interface with HTML and CSS. As the logic was already in place, I only needed to focus on the DOM aspect of the game. This project allowed me to strengthen the following skills.

**CSS**
* Flexbox to create the layout
* CSS transitions to make a better UI

**Javascript**
* Logic to get User input when selection is picked
* Logic to get a random choice from a computer
* Logic to declare a winner with the two choices
* Logic to reset the game and play again
* DOM to update the score and to display the winner of both the round and game
